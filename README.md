Git is the most widelyâ€‘used version control system in the world today.

Git is a version control system, also known as a VCS. This version control refers to the process of saving files or versions throughout the stages in life of a project where you can retrieve past versions at any time.

Git is a time machine.

Git tracks changes made to files in a project and creates a unique identifier to each change so that it's easily discoverable if you ever want to go back and retrieve a version of the project or revert a change that you've made.

Git stores each saved version of your project as a complete snapshot of the entire project's file system at that specific point in time. This snapshot captures everything in the project, including its history and all of its metadata.

Git won't perform any action without you clearly telling it what to do. Git won't autosave your work or complete those snapshots, unless you explicitly tell Git to do it. Every Git action requires your explicit command or instruction.
